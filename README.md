Welcome to the MinesweeperAI project! 
This is an extension of my previous [minesweeper](https://github.com/pronoob828/Minesweeper) project which was just a simple game. 
I have been meaning to make a minesweeper solver for ages.
Finally got around to it and made some enhancements to the UI while I was at it.

Added something a little extra with the visualization, hope you enjoy watching computers solve things.

## Features
- Solver Functionality: Automatically solve the game.
- Adjustable Speed: Control the solver's animation speed.
- Customizable Board: Easily modify the board dimensions and mine count.
- Algorithm Visualizer: Watch how the blocks change colors based on the AI's knowledge.
    - Red marks a mine.
    - Green marks a safe square.
    - Orange indicates that the move made was random, the AI doesn't (and can't) know for sure which squares are safe.
    - Blue indicates a safe move.

## Demo

## To Run
Just open all_in_one.html.
The other files made development easier due to modularity, but need a liveserver to run due to ES 6 modules
