Welcome to the Minesweeper project! This is a browser-based implementation of the classic Minesweeper game, complete with a solver and a visually appealing interface.
## Features

- Adjustable Speed: Control the solver's animation speed.
- Customizable Board: Easily modify the board dimensions and mine count.

## Demo

## To Run
Just open all_in_one.html.
The other files made development easier due to modularity, but need a liveserver to run due to ES 6 modules
